<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Alison Wayland and I’m a highly creative artist with excellent skills in print, branding, illustration and photo
  manipulation. I am a proficient Graphic Designer with creating and completing countless designs for over 30 years. My
  level of expertise has helped me work with many clients and organizations to help their business grow and to help
  problem solve.</p>
  
  <p>My area of expertise focuses on logo design, brand identity, illustration, digital photography, photo manipulation,
  photo retouching, flyers, posters, T- shirt design, stickers, menus, cards, invitations and much more.</p>
  
  <p>I am disciplined and dedicated to work with each project in a professional and timely manner. I am consistent and
  hardworking with every project I take on and I am committed to helping any company with their design needs.</p>

  <p>I would describe myself as being positive to change. I consider it as a good challenge to create something
  extraordinary out of nothing. Creative decisions are inherent to change and I am happy to look at a challenge from
  other angles to make corrections in order to give my clients a positive experience when working with me.

  <p>The professional experiences I have gained enables me to be a productive and proactive designer. It is necessary
  to communicate and work with my clients to complete difficult and time-sensitive projects. In my previous role, I
  worked along side team members and other departments of the Maricopa Institute for Arts and Entertainment Technology
  and MCTV. We completed challenging projects with tight deadlines and delivered projects to clients in graphics for
  print, web, on-air graphics, 3Danimation and overall TV production. Througout each task, I ensured I carried out
  my duties to a high standard while supporting other team members. In 2000 I had the honor to art direct the graphics
  and branding for The 20th Annual Southwest Film Festival. I am an artistically strong, self-motivated team member
  and I will complete tasks in a timely and reasonable manner. I continually look to creatively improve and grow with
  all projects I take on, big or small. When I work independently with freelance jobs, I make sure to apply my group
  working ethics with my clients. I am eager to hear what ideas clients have in mind for their design needs.
  This gives me and my clients the opportunity to brainstorm and bounce ideas back and forth.</p>
  
  <p>My work is something I’m seriously proud of and deeply love. I understand that the success of a client’s business
  or organization is extremely dependent on the performance of artists like me who have the creative skills that can
  have a significant impact on one’s results. I am confident I have those necessary skills, qualities, and attributes
  to excel within the role and to also help clients successfully achieve their mission and objectives.</p>
