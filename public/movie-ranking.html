<hr >

<h3>Kaku Ren Bo: Hide & Seek</h3>
<p>Here is a unique film. This one actually scared me a bit,
especially with the way the story ends. I deffinitely didn't expect it.</p>

<h3>The Fifth Element</h3>
<p>I loved this one. It was a beautiful sci fi film
with a ton of action, humor and a fun soundtrack.</p>

<h3>Stand By Me</h3>
<p>This film is very special to me. I was around the same age as the
characters when this film came out and it was the last film I saw with
my grandmother.</p>
